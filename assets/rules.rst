## Story

In Sky Hiking you will join a team of adventurers trying to ride a hot air balloon! 
Each turn, a different player will be the pilot and will have to pay a number of 
cards determined by a dice roll. The other players will then decide if they leave 
the balloon for victory points, or stay and risk crashing.
As the balloon goes higher, you can get more victory points, but the risk of
crashing grows. 

**Are you willing to push your luck?**



## Rules

### Flow of the Game

Every player has a hand of colored cards. The cards are 
<font color="red">**red**</font>, 
<font color="purple">**purple**</font>, 
<font color="yellow">**yellow**</font>, 
<font color="green">**green**</font> 
and 
<font color="white">**"wild"**</font>,
 which is marked in white. 

Each round the hot air balloon will start from the first level and get higher 
with every successful turn. Each turn, the designated pilot will roll a number 
of dice based on the height of the balloon (the higher the balloon is, more dice
are rolled). Each die contains one side of each color and two blank sides. 

The pilot will have to pay a card of the same color for each die rolled 
(unless it's blank, of course), or, if he can (and wants to), he can pay one 
wild card for the entire turn. **Before** he pays, each player will have to 
decide if they trust him to have the necessary cards and *stay* on the balloon 
or *leave* and get a number of victory points. After all players have decided, 
the pilot either pays, in which case the balloon rises to the next level, or, 
if the pilot can't pay (or won't play a wild card), the balloon crashes and 
nobody on it gets any points! 

In the upper side of the screen, you can see the level meter:

	<img src="file:///android_asset/levels.PNG" width="95%" alt="Level Meter"/>
</center>

The top number is the number of victory points for leaving in this stage, 
while the bottom number (in parenthesis) is the number of dice thrown. You can 
see that the last level (25 points) has no dice rolled in it - once you reach 
it, everyone on the balloon gets 25 points and a new round starts immediately.

### End of Game
If at the end of the round there are players with more than 50 points, the game
ends and the player with the most points is the winner!


## Good Luck!
