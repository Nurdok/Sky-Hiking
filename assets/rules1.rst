## Story

In Sky Hiking you will join a team of adventurers trying to ride a hot air balloon! 
Each turn, a different player will be the pilot and will have to pay a number of 
cards determined by a dice roll. The other players will then decide if they leave 
the balloon for victory points, but the higher you go, so do the prizes get bigger. 

Are you willing to push your luck?



## Rules

Every player has a hand of colored cards. The cards are 
<font color="red">**red**</font>, 
<font color="purple">**purple**</font>, 
<font color="yellow">**yellow**</font>, 
<font color="green">**green**</font> 
and 
<font color="white">**"wild"**</font>,
 which is marked in white. 

Each round the hot air balloon will start from the first level and get higher 
with every successful turn. Each turn, the designated pilot will roll a number 
of dice based on the height of the balloon. Each die contains one side of each 
color and two blank sides. The pilot will have to pay a card of the same color 
for each die thrown (unless it's blank, of course), or, if he can and wants to, 
he can pay one wild card for the entire turn. However, **before** he pays, 
every player will have to decide if they trust him to have the necessary cards 
and *stay* on the balloon or *leave* and get a number of victory points. After 
all players have decided, the pilot either pays, in which case the balloon rises 
to the next level, or, if the pilot can't pay (or won't play a wild card), the 
balloon crashes and nobody on it gets any points!
